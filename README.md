> React+Redux (observables) project with Firebase as BaaS.

## Build Setup

npm install

# serve at localhost:8080
npm start

### Why redux observables?
It was a challenge of some kind. Middleware that I'm using usually is redux-saga.

### Why custom form logic?
It was a challenge of some kind too. I'm aware of redux-form and it scales way better then any custom logic but for such small project custom logic still works fine.
